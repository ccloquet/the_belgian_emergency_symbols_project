Version 1.0 (published 30 March 2012)

Civil Contingencies Secretariat in the Cabinet Office, working in partnership with Ministry of Defence and Ordnance Survey, has created a set of common map symbols, linked to the common terminology of the Civil Protection Lexicon, to promote interoperability between emergency responders.

The symbols are published as a statement of good practice, the adoption of which will promote interoperability and enable shared situational awareness.

Ordnance Survey (OS) has converted the point elements of the symbology into Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG) format, and in response to feedback from user groups, now also into the raster graphics image file format BMP. Sets of the common map symbols in both SVG and BMP formats can be downloaded from the Ordnance Survey page here.

Cabinet Office and OS are continuing to work together on other formats, both generic and software-specific, and if you would like to receive email updates on progress please send an email to claudine.scatchard@cabinet-office.x.gsi.gov.uk with COMMON SYMBOLOGY in the subject line.
